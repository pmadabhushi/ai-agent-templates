# AGENTS.md — Coding Agent

> This file is read automatically by AI coding agents at session start. Do not duplicate content from README.md.

## Repo Overview

- **Service:** [ServiceName]
- **Primary language:** [Language]
- **Package structure:** [Describe top-level packages, e.g., `core/`, `api/`, `lib/`, `tests/`]
- **Design doc index:** [Link to design doc index]

## Build Conventions

- Always build packages in this order: `[package-1]` → `[package-2]` → `[package-3]`
- Use `[build tool and command]` to build (e.g., `make build` or `mvn clean install`)
- Run unit tests before raising any CR: `[test command]`
- Do NOT build packages unless explicitly instructed to do so before raising a CR

## Branch Strategy

- Main branch: `mainline`
- Feature branches: `[your-alias]/[ticket-id]-[short-description]`
- Always raise **two CRs per change**: one targeting `mainline`, one targeting `[secondary-branch]`
- Never commit directly to `mainline`

## Code Review Workflow

1. Identify all changed packages
2. Build each changed package (unless instructed otherwise)
3. Run unit tests for changed packages
4. Create CR using `[CR tool/command]`
5. Add reviewers: [list default reviewers or reviewer group]
6. Link to the relevant design doc or ticket
7. Post CR summary to `[team channel]`

## Design Patterns & Conventions

- Follow [pattern name] for all new service integrations
- All public APIs must have corresponding contract tests
- Never modify shared interfaces in `[shared-package]` without flagging for team review
- Error handling: always use `[ErrorHandlingClass/pattern]`; never swallow exceptions silently

## Safety Rules

- Do NOT push credentials, secrets, or API keys to the repo under any circumstances
- Do NOT modify `[critical-config-file]` without explicit approval
- Flag any change to shared interfaces or public APIs before proceeding
- If unsure about a design decision, stop and ask rather than guessing

## Skills Available

| Skill | Source | When to Load |
|---|---|---|
| Raise Code Review | `skills/raise_cr.md` | When asked to raise a CR or submit a code review |
| Run Tests | `skills/run_tests.md` | When asked to run tests or validate a change |
| Generate Changelog | `skills/generate_changelog.md` | When preparing a release or summarizing changes |

> **Importing skills from the registry:** Skills can also be pulled from [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) instead of (or alongside) local files. Add registry skills to your `template.json` using:
> - Shorthand: `"skills.sh:skill_name"` — resolves to `https://skills.sh/skill_name`
> - Full URL: `"https://skills.sh/skill_name"`
>
> Example `template.json` entry:
> ```json
> "skills": [
>   "skills/raise_cr.md",
>   "skills.sh:semantic_release",
>   "https://skills.sh/conventional_commits"
> ]
> ```

## Design Documentation

Before making changes, review the relevant design docs:

| Category | Location | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | `design/architecture/` | Component structure, data models, dependencies, design decisions |
| APIs | `design/apis/` | Endpoint specs, contracts, rate limits, versioning |
| Patterns | `design/patterns/` | Approved design patterns, implementation templates, error handling |
