## Service Overview

- **Service:** [ServiceName]
- **Infrastructure:** [Brief description, e.g., ECS on AWS, Kubernetes on GKE]
- **Environments:** `dev` → `staging` → `prod`
- **Pipeline tool:** [Tool name, e.g., Brazil, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Spinnaker]
- **Infrastructure design doc:** [Link]

## Deployment Conventions

- Always validate staging before promoting to prod
- Use `[DeployTool CLI command]` for all deployments — never deploy manually via console
- Check pipeline badge status before promoting: pipeline must be Gold or Silver
- Deployment promotion order: `dev` → `staging` → `prod`
- All prod deployments require a deployment ticket: `[ticketing system link]`

## Environment Promotion Rules

| From | To | Required Gate |
|---|---|---|
| dev | staging | Automated tests pass |
| staging | prod | Manual approval + smoke tests pass + pipeline badge >= Silver |
| prod | rollback | Error rate > [threshold]% OR explicit on-call decision |

## Rollback Procedure

1. Identify the last known good version: `[command]`
2. Initiate rollback: `[rollback command]`
3. Monitor error rate for 10 minutes post-rollback
4. Post rollback summary to `[ops channel]`

> For detailed steps, load skill: `skills/rollback_service/SKILL.md`

## Monitoring & Alerting

- Primary dashboard: [Link]
- Error rate threshold for escalation: [X]%
- Latency threshold for escalation: [X]ms at P99
- On-call rotation: [Link to on-call schedule]

## Safety Rules

- **Never** modify prod configuration without explicit confirmation from the user
- **Never** deploy to prod without a passing staging validation
- **Prefer read-only operations** when investigating — do not make changes unless instructed
- If error rate exceeds [threshold]% post-deployment, initiate rollback immediately
- All prod actions must be logged to `[audit log system]`
